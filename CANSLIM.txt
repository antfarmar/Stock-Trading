CANSLIM is a GROWTH INVESTMENT STRATEGY based on a study of 500 of the stock market winners dating back to 1953 in the book "How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System In Good Times or Bad" by William J. O'Neil, who is the founder of the Investor's Business Daily. This strategy uses both technical analysis and fundamental analysis.

The goal of the strategy is to DISCOVER LEADING STOCKS BEFORE THEY MAKE MAJOR PRICE ADVANCES. These pre-advance periods are "buy points" that are emerging from price consolidation areas (or "bases") of at least 7 weeks on weekly price charts.

C - CURRENT EARNINGS PER SHARE should be up 25% or more and in many cases accelerating in recent quarters. Quarterly sales should also be up 25% or more or accelerating over prior quarters.
(Beware of items in financial statements that can cause earnings distortions.)

A - ANNUAL EARNINGS should be up 25% or more in each of the last three years. Annual return on equity should be 17% or more.

N - NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, MANAGEMENT, PRICE HIGH, AND OTHER NEW EVENTS.
A company should have a new product or service that's fueling earnings growth. The stock should be emerging from a proper chart pattern and about to make a new high in price.

S - SUPPLY AND DEMAND. Shares outstanding can be large or small, but trading volume should be big as the stock price increases.Small supply and large demand for a stock creates excess demand, and an environment in which stock prices can soar. Companies acquiring their own stock reduces market supply and can indicate their expectation of future profitability. Look for low debt-equity ratios.

L - LEADER OR LAGGARD? Choose leaders over laggard stocks within the same industry. Buy the leading stock in a leading industry. Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a guide.  A stock's Relative Price Strength Rating should be 80 or higher. 

I - INSTITUTIONAL SPONSORSHIP should be increasing. Invest in stocks showing increasing ownership by (the best) mutual funds in recent quarters. Pick stocks who have institutional sponsorship by a few institutions with recent above average performance. IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating gauges mutual fund activity in a stock.(Be cautious of stocks that are over-owned by institutions.)

M - MARKET TREND/INDEXES. Determine market direction by reviewing market averages daily. The S&P/TSX, DOW, S&P 500 and NASDAQ, should be in a confirmed up trend since 3 out of 4 stocks follow the market's overall trend.

===========================================================================

C: CURRENT EARNINGS GROWTH

Research shows that earnings growth is the single most important indicator of a stock's potential to make a big price move. The stocks you select should show a major percentage increase in current quarterly earnings per share (the most recently reported quarter) when compared to the prior year's same quarter.

Winning Characteristics

* Large increases in current quarterly earnings per share. Look for these increases to be at least 25%. (3 out of 4 of the best-performing stocks in our research showed earnings increases of 70% or more in the quarter right before they started to make their huge price moves!)
* Preferably, look for accelerating earnings in at least the three most recent quarters.
* Check earnings consensus estimates to make sure the company is projected to be on a positive track. 

Investing Tip: The best stocks often have high - some would say ridiculous - P/E ratios when they start their big climbs. If you weren't willing to pay the higher P/Es, you eliminated most of the best stocks of all time.


A: ANNUAL EARNINGS GROWTH

As we've seen, strong current quarterly earnings are critical to picking the market's biggest winners. However, 3 out of 4 of the biggest winners in our research also showed at least some positive annual growth rate over the five years preceding the stock's big run-up. We'll also look at other key fundamentals you'll want to consider.

Winning Characteristics

* The annual earnings per share should show consistent growth over the past three to five years. Look for average annual EPS growth of at least 20% to 25%.
* Between 1980 and 2000, the median annual growth rate of all outstanding stocks in IBD's study of the greatest stock market winners, prior to big price moves, was 36%.
* Look for stocks where each of the last three years shows an increase in annual earnings, with no one single-year being down.
* It is also helpful to see either the annual pre-tax profit margin and/or the annual return on equity expanding.
* Return on Equity (ROE) should be 17% or higher.
* The last three quarters' sales should either show acceleration in the rate of increase and/or the latest quarter should be up at least 25%. 

Investing Tip: In a few cases you may accept one down year in the last five as long as the following year's earnings quickly recover and move back to new high ground. 



N: NEW PRODUCTS, NEW SERVICES, NEW MANAGEMENT, NEW PRICE HIGHS

Explosive stock growth doesn't happen in a vacuum. Usually, new products, new services, new management or new industry conditions propel stocks to new heights. In its study of the greatest stock market winners, IBD discovered that more than 95% of the successes in American industry met at least one of the above criteria. And, contrary to the beliefs of many investors, stocks that make the biggest price advances start their moves when they are already at or near new price highs. By following the old adage, "buy low, sell high" investors would have missed out on most of the biggest stock successes in market history.

Winning Characteristics

* A stock that makes big gains often results from new products or services. But be wary of unproven products, especially if the company management doesn't have a solid track record.
* Superior management is essential to a company's success. That's why often a shakeup at the top pushes a stock's price higher.
* Quality stocks making new price highs just as they emerge from sound chart bases on higher volume are often likely to continue climbing, while stocks making new lows are probably headed even lower. Therefore, focus on the new price highs list for the best potential opportunities.
* You can think of a stock's price as a measure of its quality and, consequently, its potential. Typically, stocks higher in price reflect higher quality.
* Always be on the lookout for new products, new services, new management, or major improvements in industry condition. 

Investing Tip: An IBD survey indicated that 98% of investors do not buy stocks making a new high price. An analysis was made of the IBD's new-high and new-low stock lists during several good, as well as poor, market periods. The findings were clear: stocks on the new-highs list tended to head higher, and those on the new-lows list often continued lower. 


S: SUPPLY AND DEMAND

Our study of the greatest stock market winners validates what most investors understand. When demand for a stock outpaces supply, the price usually heads north. The best way to measure a stock's supply and demand is by watching its daily trading volume. When a stock rallies up in price, you want to see volume rise at the same time, which may represent institutional buying that can really power a stock's move. When a stock pulls back in price, you want to see volume dry up indicating no significant selling pressure.

Winning Characteristics

* Watch the demand for shares by looking at the Volume % Change for each of your stocks. It will show you immediately how much a stock traded vs. its average daily volume over the last 50 trading days. For example, a stock that trades 100,000 shares on average will have a 50% Volume % Change if it trades 150,000 shares on the day.
* Stocks closing at their highs for the day or gapping up in price can indicate strong demand.
* Companies buying back their stock in the open market and companies showing stock ownership by management can be positive indications.
* When a stock breaks out of a price consolidation area, trading volume should be at least 50% above its average daily volume, indicating strong demand.
* In many cases, a strong stock breakout will see volume up 100% or more for the day, indicating solid buying and the possibility for further price increases. 

Investing Tip: A stock moving up in price on lower than normal volume could be a sign of weakness. Look for strong demand supporting price increases. 



L: LEADER OR LAGGARD

Our studies show that, on average, 37% of a stock's move is directly tied to the performance of the industry the stock is in, and another 12% is due to strength in its overall sector. That's why it's so important to track the performance of both industry and sector groups. Leadership also refers to an individual stock's performance in the market. Once you've identified the most powerful industry groups, the next step is to identify the strongest stocks in those industries.

Winning Characteristics

* Look closely at the top 20% of industry groups (Investor's Business Daily tracks 197). Our study of the greatest stock market winners show the best stocks generally come from the top 22% of industry groups. Also, you want to avoid the bottom 20% of groups. Historical analysis also shows stocks within the top half of all industry groups greatly outperform those in the bottom.
* The best-performing stocks are generally #1 in their industry based on key fundamentals, including return on equity, annual earnings growth, pretax and after-tax profit margins and its relative price strength.
* Look for confirmation of strength from at least one other company in the same industry group.
* Look for leading stocks: Our study of the greatest stock market winners found that all-star stocks had, on average, outperformed 87% of the market before they began their most dramatic price advances. In a manner of speaking, if you want to find next year's winning stocks, look at the better-performing stocks today.
* Once a general-market decline is definitely over, the first stocks to bounce back to new price highs are almost always your authentic leaders. 

Investing Tip: Stay away from "sympathy plays", meaning a stock in the same industry group as a leading company bought in hopes that the leader's luster will rub off on to it. The performance of such sympathy plays usually pale in comparison to the true leaders. Eventually they will try to move up "in sympathy" but they rarely, if ever, do as well.



I: INSTITUTIONAL SPONSORSHIP

Mutual funds and other professional investors represent the vast majority of trading activity in the market. As such, they wield tremendous influence over stock prices, capable of sending their favored stocks up significantly. Here, you'll learn how to spot stocks benefiting from "institutional sponsorship."

Winning Characteristics

* A stock should show an increasing number of institutional sponsors in recent quarters (accelerating sponsorship).
* A stock should have at least several institutional owners. If there is no institutional sponsorship, it is likely the performance will be more run of the mill.
* You want stocks owned by the most successful money managers, the ones who have a proven record for consistently selecting top-performing stocks at the right time.
* Consider giving greater weight to those stocks being bought by top-performing mutual funds, either as new positions or add-on purchases. 

Investing Tip: Many institutional investors avoid buying stocks selling for less than $15 a share. 



M: MARKET DIRECTION

Market direction is the most critical characteristic to consider when investing. Almost all the best stocks over the past five decades have made their upward moves when the overall market was strong. And historically, three out of four stocks have followed the general market trend - up as well as down. So it's critical to understand exactly what the market is doing by watching it every day. Accurately gauging the market is not a matter of luck or "Monday morning quarterbacking." There are clear telltale indicators that can help you identify market tops and bottoms.

Winning Characteristics

* Bear markets are normal and necessary and serve to clean up prior excesses. They also allow the market to create a whole new set of chart bases and leaders for the next bull market. It's important to not get discouraged or lose confidence; otherwise, you'll miss the next bull market.
* Bear markets create fear, uncertainty and a loss of confidence. When stocks hit bottom and turn up to begin the next bull market, loaded with opportunities, most investors simply don't believe it.
* New big winners emerge during the first 10 to 15 weeks of a new bull market. It's important to identify market turns early to capitalize on these great opportunities.
* The market indexes signal a market bottom. Look for the first attempt at a rally. If the rally follows through anywhere from the fourth to the tenth day of a rally (preferably by the seventh day), it is an indication of a new uptrend. For a valid follow through to occur, look for an increase in total market volume from the previous trading day and substantial price advances for the day - at least 2% in either the DOW, S&P 500 or NASDAQ Composites.
* At major market turns, you may see market indexes moving in different directions. The Dow, for instance, may be making new highs while the S&P 500 does not. It's also important to note if an index is advancing or declining at a much greater rate than another. For example, if the Dow rises 3% one day as the S&P 500 (the broader index) rises only 1%, it indicates the rally is not as broad or strong as it may appear. This is why it's helpful to study market indexes in tandem, to more easily spot confirmations or divergences at key turning points.
* Historically, market tops occur after the major market averages move into new high ground and show several days of large and increased volume with either poor price progress or actual declines in the averages.
* Few market predictions ever materialize. That's why you shouldn't listen to any personal opinions about the market. Instead study the day-to-day price and volume changes in the leading indices. The goal is not to predict the market into the distant future but rather understand its exact condition at the time. Is it in a confirmed uptrend or downtrend, and is it acting in a normal or abnormal manner?
* It's of no value to make a worthwhile gain during several years of a bull (up) cycle and then give it all back during the following bear (down) cycle. It's better to get out of the elevator on one of the floors on the way up than to ride it all the way back down. 

Investing Tip: Many of the biggest investing opportunities can be found right as the market begins a confirmed change in direction. 


STOCK MARKET MYTHS
*  Buy Low, Sell High.
* A stock that's run up in price is too expensive. Buy cheap stocks.
* Buy on dips.
* Hot tips are a good reason for buying a stock.
* Big name companies are better investments than small unknown companies.
* Don't sell at a loss.
* If a stock drops in value, dollar cost average down to reduce your cost price per share.
* Market timing is impossible.
